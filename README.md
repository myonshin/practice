I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Indiana University Bloomington. I expect to graduate in May 2023 and will be available for interviews at the 2023 ASSA meeting.

'Myong Jong' is my first name(Korean) and I go by 'MJ' for short(no middle name).

Website is currently under construction and more materials will be updated soon!
